I have been thinking for some years of starting my own open lab notebook. When I was in graduate school, I first came across the lab notebook of Dr. Carl Boettiger <https://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html> and later stumbled upon another lab notebook by Dr. Tad Dallas <https://taddallas.github.io/LabNotebook/>. Both of these open lab notebooks have made me appreciate the level of transparency involved in the research process and the dissemination of science to the research community and public at large. I look forward to experiment with the notebook format as a way to update the status of various research projects and to keep track of the flow of research ideas.
