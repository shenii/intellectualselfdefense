Welcome to my open lab notebook. I am a population ecologist studying multiple species interactions in microbial systems. This notebook serves as an accountability tool to streamline projects and track research progress. To learn my about my research you can visit my [website](https://www.senay.io). This blog was built using the Hugo platform on the Wowchemy site, Academic template, and hosted on Github.

Feel free to reach out with  any questions/suggestions.

Thanks for reading!
