Welcome to my open lab notebook. I am a population ecologist studying host-microbe interactions. The notebook will serve as an accountability tool to streamline projects and track research progress over time. To learn my about my research you can visit my [website](https://www.senay.io). This blog was built using the Hugo platform on the Wowchemy site, templating Academic, and hosted on Github.

Feel free to reach out with  any questions/suggestions.

Thanks for reading!
